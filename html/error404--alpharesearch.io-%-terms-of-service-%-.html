            <h3 id="google-sheets">Google Sheets add-on</h3>
            <p>
                Use of Google user data: When you use AlphaResearch's Google Sheets add-on, from the sidebar, you will
                be asked to enter your email and password of your AlphaResearch account in order to verify your access.
                Once we verify the email and password are correct, we will store a token in your Google Sheet account
                linked with our add-on (we use userProperty as illustrated in this <a target="_blank"
                                                                                      href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties">link</a>)
                When you use our custom functions, only the input you enter in that function together with the above
                token will be sent to us. We use that token to verify you are an AlphaResearch customer and use the
                other inputs
                to query the correct data. We do not save these inputs and we do not know your Google account email.
                AlphaResearch will also be allowed to edit your spreadsheets in order to populate the spreadsheets with
                financial data retunred by the custom function.
                We do not use any other data and we do not store or share any Google user data from our Google Sheets
                add-on.
