right
to
be
informed
over
what
personal
data
we
hold
and
how
we
are
using
it.
This 
information is contained within this privacy notice.

you
have
consented
to
particular
uses
of
your
personal
data,
you
have
the
right
to
withdraw
this 
consent at any time.

we
have
collected
with

consent
or

request
copies
of
all
the
personal
data
we
hold
for

purpose
in
a
structured,
commonly
used,
and

this
to
you
free
of
charge
on
request.

to 
these
requests
within
one
month,
unless
the
request
is
particularly
complex,

right

contact
you
within
30
days 
with
further
information.
You
will
not
be
charged
for
making
a
subject
access
request
unless
we 
reasonably
deem
this
to
be
a
manifestly
unfounded
or
excessive
request,
in
which
instance
you
will 
be charged a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs of providing the information.

some
of
the
personal

we
hold
is

incomplete,

grounds
relating
to
your
particular 
situation.

you
object,
we
will
stop
using
your
personal
data
in
this
way
immediately,
unless
there
are 
compelling
legitimate
grounds
for
processing
your
personal
data
which
override
your
interests,
rights 
and
freedoms
(such
as
requests
by
law
enforcement)
or
we
need
to
process
your
data
for
the 
establishment,
exercise
or
defence
of
legal
claims.

may
always
object
to
further
use
of
your 
data

direct
marketing
purposes

note

not
always
possible

us
to
comply
with
a
request
for
erasure;

in
performance
of
a
contract,
we
cannot

comply
with
a
request
for
erasure 
unless we no longer have an active contract with you and the data is more than six years old.

the
processing
of
your
personal
data
in
certain
circumstances,
such
as 
when

with
our
legitimate
interests
or
when
you
contest 
the accuracy of the data we hold on you.
