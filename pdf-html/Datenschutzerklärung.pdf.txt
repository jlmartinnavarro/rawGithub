This can be informaEon such as: your name, your date of birth, your e-mail address, your postal address, your telephone number, your cell phone number, informaEon about your device (e.g. IP address, a numerical code used to idenEfy your device, which may provide informaEon about the country, region or city in which you are located); - informaEon about your personal circumstances and how you use our websites and services.  Legal basis  Your data will be treated in accordance with the following legal provisions:   - With regard to data transmieed with your consent for contacEng you, newsleeers, etc., Art. 6(1) lit. (a) GDPR  - With regard to services that you use to fulﬁll a contract or when iniEaEng a contract, Art. 6(1) lit. (b) GDPR   - Otherwise, in parEcular with regard to staEsEcal data and online idenEﬁers based on legiEmate interests, Art. 6(1) lit. (f) GDPR (see below).  Our speciﬁc legal basis for the collecEon, use and disclosure of your data depends on the informaEon concerned and the context in which it is processed. As a rule, however, we will only process your data if we need it to fulﬁll a contract with you, if it is in our legiEmate interest or if we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also be legally obliged to process your data. The following is a general list of purposes for data collecEon and processing:  - Processing in connecEon with contacEng us:   If you contact us (e.g. by email), your data will be processed in order to carry out pre-contractual measures, to fulﬁll our contract with you or because it is in our legiEmate interest to do so.  - General processing in the context of our business relaEonship:   Where your data is processed in order to carry out business transacEons and process the sale of the Service, your data is processed in order to perform pre-contractual measures, to fulﬁll our contract with you or because it is in our legiEmate interest to do so.  - Processing for direct markeEng purposes:   When we contact you to inform you about news from our company, oﬀers and events and to promote our own range of services, your data will be processed either on the basis of your consent or because it is in our legiEmate interests to do so.  - Processing to manage security and improve our services: We process your data to ensure system security, technically manage the service, opEmize service quality and improve the service when it is in our legiEmate interest to do so. We do not rely on this lawful basis if our legiEmate interests are overridden by your interests.  Processing to comply with our legal obligaEons: We may process your data to comply with our legal obligaEons, for example, for tax, accounEng and audit purposes.  Third-party provider registra4on  We may receive informaEon about you from third parEes. For example, if you log in to the Service using a third party account (such as Facebook), we may also collect certain informaEon from the third party that is necessary to authenEcate your account, such as your email address and other informaEon that you allow the third party to share with us. You should always check and, if necessary, adjust your privacy sejngs on third-party websites and services before linking or connecEng them to our Service. You can also unlink your third-party account from our websites by adjusEng your sejngs on the third-party service. If you unlink your third-party account, we will no longer receive any informaEon collected about you in connecEon with that service.  Informa4on we collect through your use of the Service  Each Eme you visit a page, our servers automaEcally record certain informaEon that your web browser sends. This includes informaEon such as your IP address, browser type and language, browsing and uploading behavior, other user interacEons with your uploaded media, pages viewed, date and Eme. This data is used to ensure the stability of the service and is automaEcally deleted aQer seven days.  For more informaEon on how we use cookies and other technologies, please see the "Cookies" secEon below.  Processed data, data sources and purpose of use  We collect and process personal data for the purpose of providing our soQware product (Bluepic Studio and Bluepic Social). Depending on use, various personal data is collected and stored for this purpose. There is no use beyond the purpose of using the soQware. In the following, we will provide you with a detailed breakdown of the purpose for which data is collected, whether and how it is passed on to third parEes, whether and for how long it is stored and what rights you are enEtled to.  Name and e-mail address  - Need: required - Purpose: To ensure the authenEcity of your person as well as the communicaEon, we collect an e-mail address as well as a freely selectable name. From this we create a so-called "User", to which a unique Id ("User Id") is assigned. - Storage: Permanently, you can delete this data by deleEng your Bluepic user account  Access 4me, IP address, device informa4on (user agent) & performance  - Need: required - Purpose: In order to ensure the error-free and correct funcEoning of our soQware, we collect informaEon such as the type of terminal device you are using, the browser as well as the speed of the internet connecEon. This data is used by us for the provision of our services and to oﬀer a smooth and funcEonal soQware, and is stored in so-called "log ﬁles". These are ﬁles in which we store your IP address, the Eme of use, the speed of your Internet connecEon and device informaEon. - Storage: Temporarily, for 2 weeks   Projects, Resources & Files  - Need: opEonal - Purpose: The purpose of our soQware is to create graphics. In doing so, you can use texts, shapes and eﬀects. Accordingly, these graphics indirectly contain the personal data that you add. And these graphics along with the resources such as fonts or images are stored with us to ensure the smooth retrieval and performance of the graphics templates. - Storage: Temporary, project-related. You can delete these ﬁles at any Eme via the soQware.  Images and videos  - Need: opEonal - Purpose: Within our soQware we oﬀer, as already menEoned in the previous point, the use of resources like fonts or images. We store these temporarily for the duraEon of use of the respecEve project or graphic. - Storage: Temporary. If you create a graphic in Bluepic Social, images you upload there will be stored as long as the graphic is in a creaEon process as "DraQ" (draQ). Within Bluepic Studio, graphics and fonts are stored unEl the project they belong to is deleted or the graphics are manually deleted by you before.  External fonts  - Need: opEonal - Purpose: Within our soQware we oﬀer not only the upload of fonts, but also the direct integraEon via a public link. In principle, it is possible to integrate any font that can be accessed via a public URL as a CSS ﬁle. This results in:   1. while accessing a template/ project in Bluepic Sopcial as well as in Bluepic Studio, a connecEon is established with the server behind the URL. Accordingly, informaEon such as IP address, device type and Eme are transmieed. You are responsible for the privacy-compliant integraEon of fonts to the users of your graphic templates insofar as we oﬀer here only an interface to external resources in generic form.   2. even if in principle the input of each URL is possible, we oﬀer a simpliﬁed form of the integraEon of "Google Fonts" by displaying all Google Fonts and thus directly enable the integraEon via the associated URL. If you use this funcEon in Bluepic Studio, you agree to the transfer of informaEon such as IP address, device type and Eme to Google's servers in the USA, as the use of this funcEon is opEonal. In such a case, the Google fonts will be displayed as examples within our soQware, which means that the informaEon such as IP address, device type and Eme will be passed on to Google Fonts speciﬁcally during the session in Bluepic Studio. If you include such a font in your project, it will also be included each Eme you access the speciﬁc template/ project. Since this is a funcEon that you have programmed yourself, for which Bluepic Studio merely provides an interface, you are also responsible for data protecEon-compliant use vis-à-vis third parEes (e.g. through embedding) and for obtaining the necessary permissions. - Storage: Temporary.   Payment informa4on  - Need: opEonal, necessary as soon as paid subscripEons are booked. - Purpose: We process our payments enErely through the service provider Stripe (stripe.com). This means that Bluepic Studio and Bluepic Social only link the personal and unique User-Id with a "Customer Id" within Stripe, but the payment, input of sensiEve data such as address, bank details or credit card data happens through websites provided by Stripe. The soQware products we operate therefore have no access to this sensiEve data. In order to enable the administraEon of the payment data and address, we link to a page specially created by Stripe for this purpose. There the data can be viewed, changed or deleted. - Storage: Temporary. The data is collected by Stripe and is fully administrable through the interface provided by Stripe.   Analy4cs  - Need: necessary - Purpose: To ensure the security of our soQware, we collect anonymized staEsEcs about the use of computaEonally intensive processes such as rendering on our servers. In addiEon, as part of fulﬁlling our contractual obligaEons for the soQware services we provide, we collect staEsEcs on the type and frequency of use of products such as "Spaces" or any others where the service does not include a "ﬂat rate" on usage but rather idenEﬁes a speciﬁc quota of retrievals or enEEes at a given Eme. - Storage: Temporary. Data is stored for as long as it is necessary to provide our soQware service.   Cookies  - Need: necessary - Purpose: In order to ensure the authenEcaEon of the "users" (users) against our servers, we store data objects in the so-called "local storage" on your device. These contain so-called "tokens" with which you authenEcate yourself to our servers aQer you have logged in. Likewise, our servers store so-called "session cookies" on your device, which ensure that the network connecEons you establish pass at best with the same replicas of our servers. This is necessary for the correct funcEoning of our soQware. These cookies have an automaEc expiraEon date of 60 minutes and do not contain any personal informaEon but only a unique ID that assigns your CLient to a speciﬁc replica of our servers. - Storage: Temporary over 60 minutes.

This includes images, fonts and anything else that is part of your project. You should ensure that any personal informaEon, conﬁdenEal informaEon, or User Content that you'd like to keep private is not shared via a space.
