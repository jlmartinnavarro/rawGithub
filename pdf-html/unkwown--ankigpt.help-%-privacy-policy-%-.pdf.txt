"Content") are stored by Google so that they are available to you and your class or group members.
Only the Firebase Authentication service (required for user authentication) and Firebase Hosting (web
hosting of the web app) run on Google's data centers in the United States. In this regard, we refer to the EU
Standard Contractual Clauses of the EU Commission.privacy_policy_en.md 5/28/2023
3 / 10This measure ensures that the requirements of the GDPR are strictly adhered to during data processing in
the United States.
Furthermore, we have concluded a so-called "Data Processing Agreement" with Google, which ensures that
Google only acts on our instructions and also complies with the provisions of European data protection
laws, especially the GDPR, based on this agreement.

5 / 10BFDI - Addresses and Links
However, we are also open to feedback and will address any issues if you provide us with a notification at
support@ankigpt.wtf.
6. Contacting Us
Simply put
When you contact us, we only store your data to process your request.
When you voluntarily contact us (such as by email or WhatsApp), we only store the data and messages you
provide (such as your email address, phone number, and any other voluntarily provided information) to
process your inquiry (such as contact request, consultation request, or suggestions for improvement).
The data generated in connection with the contact will be deleted or permanently anonymized once storage
is no longer necessary or processing will be restricted if legal retention obligations exist.
The transmission of your data as a result of such a request is voluntary on your part, and by doing so, you
simultaneously give your consent (legal basis is Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR). In addition, we have a legitimate
interest in processing the data under Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, as we want to respond to or process your
request. If your request aims to conclude a contract, the legal basis for processing the data is also provided
under Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR.
7. Our Handling of Your Data
Simply put
We process your data when you:
Use our app
Communicate with us
During the purely informational use of this app, which means if you do not register with your personal data
(nickname, email, etc.) or otherwise provide us with information, we only collect the access data that your
device transmits to our server.
The following non-personally identifiable access data is stored with each use of our app:
The name of the accessed file and/or content in the app
The date and time of the request
The amount of data transferred
The access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
The type of access (GET, POST)
The device and operating system used
Cookies
For reasons of data security, to investigate unauthorized access or misuse of the app, and to potentially
pursue resulting legal obligations and claims, the complete IP address of the requesting device is recorded,
stored, and automatically deleted 6 months after the end of the access.privacy_policy_en.md 5/28/2023
6 / 10If you want to use our app, we collect the aforementioned data that is technically necessary for us to even
offer you our app and ensure the improvement of stability, functionality, and security for both parties.
Therefore, the collection of this data is based on a legitimate interest on both sides (legal basis is Art. 6(1)
(f) of the GDPR).
If you are older than 16 years, the processing of the aforementioned data is based on your consent (legal
basis is Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).
8. Account
To use the app, it is necessary to create an account (customer account) or log in with an existing account
and password and have a nickname, as mentioned below.
a. Registration with Anonymous Accounts
The app can be used without providing personal data because it is not necessary to voluntarily provide any
personal data in the app (except for the IP address).
If you are under 16 years old, the use of our app is prohibited. It is exclusively intended for students and not
for school children.
Every user who presses the "Generate" button is automatically assigned an anonymous account.
With this registration method, only the IP address is processed temporarily in accordance with section 9
("9. Processing of the IP address").
The processing of the IP address is technically necessary for your device to establish a connection to our
servers and to allow you to access and use the information from your group rooms or other application
features of the app (purpose of processing).
The legal basis for the processing of the aforementioned data is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) of the
GDPR) in making the app and its application features permanently available and providing the app with
stability, functionality, and security, thereby fulfilling your legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) in
using the app to organize your school day quickly, easily, and digitally.
The disadvantage of this registration is that we cannot technically determine to whom a specific account
belongs. Therefore, the anonymous account is tied to the device with which the registration was made for
technical reasons. If you log out, uninstall the app, or lose your device, you will lose access to your account.
b. Registration with Email & Password or Google/Apple Sign In
In addition to anonymous registration, you can voluntarily register for the use of the app using an email
address and password or through Google or Apple Sign In (hereinafter referred to as "registration data"). It
is up to you which registration data you choose to use. It can even be a fantasy address like
"smartfox[at]xyz.com".
Registration using the registration data is based on your request, i.e., voluntary on your part, if and because
you reject anonymous registration in order to experience more services due to technical reasons, namely:
We store the aforementioned registration data to reset your forgotten password at your request.privacy_policy_en.md 5/28/2023
7 / 10In addition, during registration using the registration data, we can enable you to log into our app from
any device and anywhere in the world, allowing you to work flexibly and free from device constraints.
Furthermore, providing the email address allows us to keep you up to date on activities in "AnkiGPT"
and updates to the privacy policy/terms and conditions.
Additionally, we can inform you about security-related information regarding your account (e.g., login
from a foreign device).
The purpose of registration and login with the registration data is to allow you to log into your account from
any device at any time. If you have forgotten your password, you can select the "Forgot password" option.
We will then send you an email with a link to reset your password. Furthermore, this allows the prevention
and tracking of app misuse.
By voluntarily providing your registration data to take advantage of the app's technically necessary benefits,
you give your consent to the processing of the registration data (legal basis is Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR).
Without giving your consent, the use of this app is only possible according to section 9.a (anonymous
account).
9. Processing of the IP Address
The use of our app requires a connection between your device and our server to retrieve information from
the app or provide information within the app.
For this purpose, the IP address is technically necessary to enable communication between your device and
our servers. This also constitutes the purpose of processing the IP address.
Another purpose of processing the IP address is to ensure security against attacks. This helps prevent
unauthorized access by employing automated security mechanisms that protect user data from misuse.
A note on IP addresses and personal identification: The technically necessary IP address stored at Google
Firebase is not visible to us. A unique connection between an IP address and a specific internet connection,
including its owner, can only be established by the user's internet service provider for a limited period. As
an individual or company, one could only access the owner of the internet connection through a
sovereign/official act of the state (e.g., court orders, government decision, etc.) upon request, if there is a
legitimate interest (such as the enforcement of copyright infringements or criminal offenses).
Additionally, there may be cases where many devices share a single IP address, making it impossible to
identify an individual accurately (e.g., using the app via a university's Wi-Fi).
The storage of the IP address is done on Google's servers, and according to Google, it is only temporary.
Despite written inquiries to Google, it was not possible to determine the exact storage period.
In addition, we store the IP address when you accept the privacy policy to fulfill our obligation to provide
evidence.
Due to statutory limitation periods, we are required to store this data for 3 years. The deletion period begins
at the end of the year in which the data was stored.
The legal basis for the technically necessary processing of the IP address is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)
(f) of the GDPR) in making the app and its application features permanently available, providing the app withprivacy_policy_en.md 5/28/2023
8 / 10stability, functionality, and security, thereby fulfilling your legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) in
using the app to organize your school day quickly, easily, and digitally.
In the cases of section 9.b., the legal basis for the processing of your IP address, in addition to the
legitimate interest, is your consent in accordance with Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.
If you do not agree to the storage of your IP address, the app cannot be used for technical reasons.
10. Storage Period and Retention Obligations
Unless otherwise specified in this privacy policy, the data collected within the scope of support requests
through our own services will be stored for a period of 2 years, unless we have a legal obligation to retain
the data.
All retention periods begin at the end of the month in which the processing of the request is completed.
In other cases, the duration of the storage of personal data is determined by legal retention obligations
(such as commercial or tax law). After the expiration of the retention period, the data will be deleted at the
end of the month, unless it is necessary for the initiation, performance, and termination of a contract and/or
there is a legitimate interest on our part in processing the data.
If the app is not used for more than two years, the account will be automatically deleted.
11. Use of GPT by OpenAI
To generate flashcards, the GPT API by OpenAI, L.L.C. is used. Therefore, you are not allowed to insert
personal data into the text that serves as the basis for generation. As long as you do not insert personal
data into the text, no personal data will be transmitted to OpenAI, L.L.C.
You can find the privacy policy of OpenAI, L.L.C. here: OpenAI Privacy Policy
12. Anonymous Statistical Analysis of App Usage
To continuously improve and make the app more user-friendly, the app collects completely anonymous
statistical data on app usage. This data cannot be traced back to any individual user. For example, this data
helps identify frequently occurring errors in specific sections of the app, which can then be improved.
13. Recipients or Categories of Recipients
In general, the personal data you provide to us is only processed by us. However, to fulfill our tasks and
obligations, it may be necessary for us to disclose your personal data to natural and legal persons,
authorities, institutions, or other entities. The following categories of recipients may be considered:
Google Cloud, as mentioned in Section 4. Hosting, Backend Infrastructure, and Storage Location for
Your Data
Courts (e.g., in litigation proceedings)
Non-public entities, if they act as processors
Lawyers, tax advisors, notaries, auditors
14. SSL/TLS Encryptionprivacy_policy_en.md 5/28/2023
9 / 10For the purpose of data security and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as the
inquiries you send to us, this app uses SSL/TLS encryption, which is provided by Google Firebase by
default. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the change of the browser's address bar from
"http://" to "https://" and the padlock symbol in the browser bar. Through SSL/TLS encryption, the data you
transmit to us cannot be read by third parties during transmission.
15. Data Transfer to Third Countries outside the EU
a. Firebase Authentication
To use AnkiGPT, it is necessary to have a user account (the reason for this necessity has been explained in
detail in Section 8. Account).
For security reasons, the IP address is temporarily logged and may be retained in backups for up to 180
days according to Google.
If you have linked your account with an email address or a Google account, this email address (or the email
address associated with the Google account) is stored in Firebase Authentication because this information
is required for login.
The Firebase Authentication service is hosted by Google in the United States. To enable privacy-compliant
processing, we have concluded EU Standard Contractual Clauses with Google.
The legal basis for the temporary storage of the IP address, in the case of registration according to section
9 lit. b, is your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) to use the service. Otherwise, the technically necessary storage
is based on your and our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in providing the app in a performant manner.
b. Firebase Hosting
Firebase Hosting is used for web hosting of the web app (https://ankigpt.wtf). If you use the AnkiGPT web
app, you send a request to Firebase Hosting to load the page.
For security reasons, the IP address is logged with each access. This IP address is stored for a few months
according to Google.
The Firebase Hosting service is hosted by Google in the United States. To enable privacy-compliant
processing, we have concluded EU Standard Contractual Clauses with Google.
The legal basis for the temporary storage of the IP address, in the case of registration according to section
9 lit. b, is your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) to use the service. Otherwise, the technically necessary storage
is based on your and our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in providing the web app in a performant
manner.
16. Data Protection Officer
The data controller is required to provide the contact details of their designated data protection officer, if
the obligation to appoint a data protection officer exists under Article 37 GDPR.
Currently, we are not obligated to have a data protection officer.
17. Reservation of Changes to this Informationprivacy_policy_en.md 5/28/2023
10 / 10Changes in legal requirements or laws may require an adaptation of this information. Therefore, we kindly
ask you to review this information each time you visit our website.
